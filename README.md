# LibDuelistsOfTheRoses

LibDuelistsOfTheRoses is a C# implementation of the Duelists of the Roses PS2 card game. 
The goal of this project is to define projects for file interfaces and types, along with some default implementations.

Essentially, this is the logic of the game separated from the Unity project I started a few months ago.

I am accepting any and all suggestions on this. In its current state, it is not complete but the interfaces closely match types I originally created for the remake.
